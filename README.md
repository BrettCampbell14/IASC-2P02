## Featured Project: [Blackberry Phones - How Things Could Have Gone Differently](https://brettcampbell14.github.io/IASC-2P02/reveal/index.html)

In this project, I discussed the downfall of Blackberry phones, the rise of competitor brands (specifically Apple's iPhone), and considered the counterfactual reality where the Blackberry remained in the spotlight. Topics that were explored were how the Blackberry would have fit in, how it would have functioned, how other brands would co-exist with it, and how Blackberry as a company would have continued to develop and exist in the modern day. This was presented as a Pucha Kucha, a format which encouraged free speaking from the presenter. The project doesn’t push towards any real argument and doesn’t lean towards either side, but rather, provides the listeners with a number of different ideas to consider. I believe with a topic like this one – while there are “winners” and “losers” amongst tech companies – there is no right or wrong method of going about developing products, but rather, there are some ideas that were more accepted at that time and some that were not. Both positives and negatives are given in relation to both Blackberry phones as well as its competitors (again, more specifically iPhones). In the end, what the listener can take away is that technology is not moving on a solid path going from bad to good to better. Instead, we are moving in a direction based on going forward with what was found to be successful in its time, which doesn’t necessarily mean that the failing ideas or brands were worse or less important.


After creating and presenting my Pucha Kucha, I received feedback from my instructor on what could have been done differently, highlighting the shortcomings of the project. The main issue that was brought up was that none of the images I had created myself for the presentation would appear when it was being presented – though they would appear on my own computer. To remedy this, I went back to the index.html and replaced all the image files that weren’t showing up properly, which can be seen [here]( https://github.com/BrettCampbell14/IASC-2P02/commit/e19c410bcd17ddb748ce8ea1ca274ba72b6ab975#diff-890f068779e43beb317787310daafa5c). Beyond these revisions, I expanded upon my main argument of how Blackberry phones could have continued to exist and its implications on other technology by adding in new slides that provide more counterfactual examples and go deeper into the topic. This added an additional five slides to the Pucha Kucha. Speaker notes were added into each of these new slides, going into detail on what these new points are specifically getting at. These notes, as well as the new slides were added in these commits [1]( https://github.com/BrettCampbell14/IASC-2P02/commit/afb3061b8752f073786f013c4a228baec977cfbd#diff-890f068779e43beb317787310daafa5c), [2]( https://github.com/BrettCampbell14/IASC-2P02/commit/f820d8033c4176026295e853e1593dd64ab78312#diff-890f068779e43beb317787310daafa5c). In my new points I brought up the idea that, had Blackberry phones continued to exist today as one of the big names beside iPhones, would they still remain true to their initial strategy. Would Blackberries bandwagon onto the same features we see in all our smartphones now? Or would they be the influencers themselves, creating the trends that the other brands would piggyback off of?

## Collaborative Project

In this project, myself and my groupmates explored the tool Prism, a program created by the Scholar’s Lab of the University of West Virginia. This website was developed with the aim of “crowdsourcing interpretation.” The tool allows users to give their interpretation of the texts provided and compare it against other’s interpretations. As a group, we tested the programs various features, from interpreting other user’s texts, to uploading our own to be interpreted by others. We created a slideshow presentation from the information we gathered, with each of us focusing on specific aspects of our findings. My part can be found below.

Here is my 250 word collaboration statement. (include image and commit) I approach collaboration in x ways which is reflected in y work (available [here] (link commit)) I also approach collaboration in a ways which is reflected in b work, and that is available [here](link another commit) i also contributed x assets to my team as seen below. approach and philosophy of working in teams and collaborating

## Bio

Currently a second year student at Brock University's Interactive Arts and Sciences program with a specific focus on design and digital expression. The projects featured in this page demonstrate different areas of knowledge related to digital scholarship. Through my time in Brock University’s IASC program, I have developed my understanding of design, digital prototyping, theoretical concepts and the like with the aims of achieving a well rounded portfolio that demonstrates my many strengths as a student. I am passionate about this field of study and aim to take these skills with me beyond university into the professional world as well.


## Featured Project: [Blackberry Phones - How Things Could Have Gone Differently](https://brettcampbell14.github.io/IASC-2P02/reveal/index.html)

In this project, I discussed the downfall of Blackberry phones, the rise of competitor brands (specifically Apple's iPhone), and considered the counterfactual reality where the Blackberry remained in the spotlight. Topics that were explored were how the Blackberry would have fit in, how it would have functioned, how other brands would co-exist with it, and how Blackberry as a company would have continued to develop and exist in the modern day. This was presented as a Pucha Kucha, a format which encouraged free speaking from the presenter. The project doesn’t push towards any real argument and doesn’t lean towards either side, but rather, provides the listeners with a number of different ideas to consider. I believe with a topic like this one – while there are “winners” and “losers” amongst tech companies – there is no right or wrong method of going about developing products, but rather, there are some ideas that were more accepted at that time and some that were not. Both positives and negatives are given in relation to both Blackberry phones as well as its competitors (again, more specifically iPhones). In the end, what the listener can take away is that technology is not moving on a solid path going from bad to good to better. Instead, we are moving in a direction based on going forward with what was found to be successful in its time, which doesn’t necessarily mean that the failing ideas or brands were worse or less important.


After creating and presenting my Pucha Kucha, I received feedback from my instructor on what could have been done differently, highlighting the shortcomings of the project. The main issue that was brought up was that none of the images I had created myself for the presentation would appear when it was being presented – though they would appear on my own computer. To remedy this, I went back to the index.html and replaced all the image files that weren’t showing up properly, which can be seen [here]( https://github.com/BrettCampbell14/IASC-2P02/commit/e19c410bcd17ddb748ce8ea1ca274ba72b6ab975#diff-890f068779e43beb317787310daafa5c). Beyond these revisions, I expanded upon my main argument of how Blackberry phones could have continued to exist and its implications on other technology by adding in new slides that provide more counterfactual examples and go deeper into the topic. This added an additional five slides to the Pucha Kucha. Speaker notes were added into each of these new slides, going into detail on what these new points are specifically getting at. These notes, as well as the new slides were added in these commits [1]( https://github.com/BrettCampbell14/IASC-2P02/commit/afb3061b8752f073786f013c4a228baec977cfbd#diff-890f068779e43beb317787310daafa5c), [2]( https://github.com/BrettCampbell14/IASC-2P02/commit/f820d8033c4176026295e853e1593dd64ab78312#diff-890f068779e43beb317787310daafa5c). In my new points I brought up the idea that, had Blackberry phones continued to exist today as one of the big names beside iPhones, would they still remain true to their initial strategy. Would Blackberries bandwagon onto the same features we see in all our smartphones now? Or would they be the influencers themselves, creating the trends that the other brands would piggyback off of?


## Collaborative Project

In this project, myself and my groupmates explored the tool Prism, a program created by the Scholar’s Lab of the University of West Virginia. This website was developed with the aim of “crowdsourcing interpretation.” The tool allows users to give their interpretation of the texts provided and compare it against other’s interpretations. As a group, we tested the programs various features, from interpreting other user’s texts, to uploading our own to be interpreted by others. We created a slideshow presentation from the information we gathered, with each of us focusing on specific aspects of our findings. My part can be found below.


Through collaboration, my team was able to form a deeper understanding of the programs function, by comparing our own experiences using Prism against each other. Prism is a website that relies on comparing different perspectives and therefore, exploring its functions on one’s own would only cover one angle of a multi-faceted program. To organize how we’d execute this assignment, my teammates and I split the presentation into four parts, with each of us covering one topic. To create our group presentation my group made use of google slides, allowing each of us to complete our own parts on our own time. Here are two of my slides in which I discussed the use of Prism as a tool for making multimodal arguments as well as whether it could be used in future courses in our program:

This also allowed us to view each others work and make constructive comments on what could be improved and what could be done differently. In addition to working over a shared powerpoint, we also decided to meet up together in person to discuss our progress on the assignment. While working entirely over the internet would have sufficed, we found it would be beneficial to meet in person as this would encourage us to be working at – more or less – the same pace and will keep ourselves accountable of having a certain amount completed by that date so it wouldn’t be left to the last minute. As a group we were able to combine our strengths as well as accommodate for each others weaknesses to create a polished finished project. My slides for this project can be found in [this commit.]( https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02-TeamPresentations/commit/f3b1a06877a21501f56f54aa45f0e93a532d7267#diff-f23dd7af6f2e736eda00dc7288e33f8f)

In this project, I discussed the downfall of Blackberry phones, the rise of competitor brands (specifically Apple's iPhone), and considered the counterfactual reality where the Blackberry remained in the spotlight. Topics that were explored were how the Blackberry would have fit in, how it would have functioned, how other brands would co-exist with it, and how Blackberry as a company would have continued to develop and exist in the modern day. This was presented as a Pucha Kucha, a format which encouraged free speaking from the presenter. The project doesn’t push towards any real argument and doesn’t lean towards either side, but rather, provides the listeners with a number of different ideas to consider. I believe with a topic like this one – while there are “winners” and “losers” amongst tech companies – there is no right or wrong method of going about developing products, but rather, there are some ideas that were more accepted at that time and some that were not. Both positives and negatives are given in relation to both Blackberry phones as well as its competitors (again, more specifically iPhones). In the end, what the listener can take away is that technology is not moving on a solid path going from bad to good to better. Instead, we are moving in a direction based on going forward with what was found to be successful in its time, which doesn’t necessarily mean that the failing ideas or brands were worse or less important.

I also made these changes which you can see [here](another link). Overall, these changes show x and y changes in my thinking.

## Collaborative Project

In this project, myself and my groupmates explored the tool Prism, a program created by the Scholar’s Lab of the University of West Virginia. This website was developed with the aim of “crowdsourcing interpretation.” The tool allows users to give their interpretation of the texts provided and compare it against other’s interpretations. As a group, we tested the programs various features, from interpreting other user’s texts, to uploading our own to be interpreted by others. We created a slideshow presentation from the information we gathered, with each of us focusing on specific aspects of our findings. My part can be found below.

Here is my 250 word collaboration statement. (include image and commit) I approach collaboration in x ways which is reflected in y work (available [here] (link commit)) I also approach collaboration in a ways which is reflected in b work, and that is available [here](link another commit) i also contributed x assets to my team as seen below. approach and philosophy of working in teams and collaborating

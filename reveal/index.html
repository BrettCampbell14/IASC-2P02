				<h2>Durability</h2>
				<p> Would modern phones be more durable? </p>

				<aside class="notes">
		Given that Blackberry phones could survive just about anything, if they had not disappeared, would their durability carry on into future generations of electronics? 
		Phones today, specifically iPhones, are programmed to become obsolete after a certain span of time. It's impossible to tell whether or not Blackberry would fall into this scheme as well or if they would continue making lasting phones in 2018.
		The fact that Blackberries weren't touch screen could contribute to their overall durability, and so, if they had continued on as "classic" phones with buttons, it can be assumed that they would be stronger than the phones we have now.

				<h2> Battery Life </h2>
				<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c4/fc/2c/c4fc2c8cbe7fcce5c7c7969fd41da4ed.jpg">
				<aside class="notes">
					On the topic of controlled obsolescence in phones, a major issue with modern day phones is their battery life and how it gets shorter and shorter as the phone ages.
					With Blackberry phones being known for their durability, had they continued to exist and develop into the modern day, would they stay true to being lasting without having deliberate downgrades over time?
					One of the reasons the public was intimidated by new phones coming out with touch screens and apps was due to the fact that they seemed fragile and buggy.
					In a counterfactual where Blackberries continued to exist, it would make sense that it would be because they were more durable and trsutworthy, and so, had they been around in the modern day, it seems likely they would still be durable.

				<h2> No more unwanted changes </h2>
					<img src="https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/iphone-7-headphone-adapter-dongle.jpg?quality=98&strip=all">
				<aside class="notes">
					Blackberry's downfall was that it tried to remain true to its initial design and remain loyal to its customers. 
					Changes were happening in the world of mobile phones, and instead of jumping on the bandwagon, the Blackberry stayed true to its roots, not adopting touchscreens which, at the time, seemed scary to some.
					With that being said, if Blackberries were still in the forefront and touch screens never took off, would we be seeing any of the huge, unwanted leaps we've seen with major phone companies now?
					An example is the removal of the headphone jack, which was not a popular decision and is still not fully accepted now. Blackberry listened to its customers fears by not jumping on touchscreens.
					If that had been the winning method of business, then we likely wouldn't be seeing any major innovations happening in phones. Or at least not at the speed we see it now. It would be more gradual so as not to intimidate the public.

				<h2> Less fun? </h2>

			<aside class="notes">
				One of the reasons Blackberry phones fell behind was that they were late to get on the trend of having apps.
				iPhones and other smartphones took the lead because they began offering more apps on their phones, turning them into gaming devices rather than having the sole function be communication.
				With that being said, if Blackberries still existed today and stayed true to their roots, would the modern cellphone still be an entertainment system like it is now? or would it be used only for its intended purpose? To communicate.

					<h2>Impacts</h2>

			<aside class="notes">
				Without iPhones shaping much of the technology we see today, how would modern technology look if it had been Blackberries that paved the way?
				With phones, tablets et cetera, would durability and quality be more prominant than they are in the technology we see today (where the focus is more on entertainment and style)?
				Incorporating games and apps to the device in some way or another seems ineviatble, but it would be nice to believe that Blackberries would stay true to being functional and durable above all.
				Other things to consider: would tablets be built with keyboards or something similar? Without the rise of iPhones, would macbooks still be as common? Would the Blackberry brand release their own computers and tablets?
